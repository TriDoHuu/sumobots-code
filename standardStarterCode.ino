    // The loop is mostly up to you, whether you want to include system states
    // as discussed in week 5's build session, 

    // Think about how you will keep track of which state the bot is current in,
    // how you will separate states from each other and what conditions will
    // make your sumobot change states

    // You can use a variable and a switch/case statement to keep track of which
    // system state you are in. If you are not sure what this is, look at the
    // loop in standardEasierStarterCode.ino
