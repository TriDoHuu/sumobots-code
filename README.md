# 🤖 sumobots-code
# Getting Started
Open up your arduino IDE and configure the right setting for your port and arduino nano.

## 🏍️ MotorControlCode.ino
This is a small program that will allow you to test whether you have soldered your motor pins correctly, and test out motor movement. You may also like to take some inspiration from the functions in your own sumobot code!


## 📁 Code files:
- standardStarterCode.ino - A basic scaffold of sumobot code
- standardEasierStarterCode.ino - The basic sumobot scaffold with examples of functions, system states, etc... for those who are less familiar with coding
- advancedStarterCode.ino - Starting scaffold for the advanced stream, may contain more complex code for a more complex sumobot.
